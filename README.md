# Customer Data Cleaning with Pandas

# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to clean and standardize a messy customer contact list using **Python (Pandas)**.  
The dataset originally contained issues such as inconsistent phone number formats, combined address fields, missing values, and customers flagged as `Do_Not_Contact`.  

The goal was to transform the raw Excel file into a clean, analysis-ready dataset and export it in both Excel and CSV formats.
